# E-Commerce App

This is a basic ecommerce application built using Node.js.

The application has two user roles

- users/visitors who do not need to login, but can add items to their cart (stored locally) and proced to checkout(view a summary of the cart)

- admins who have to sign up and login, and can add or delete items from the inventory
